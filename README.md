-----------------

## Features

### Components

- Structured with functional and class components.

### CSS

- CSS3 only
- Decided not to use a framework because i wanted to make it simple, and quick.

### Google Maps API // Google Maps React

- I decided to use this API, because it has a public package that is pretty simple to use.

- The only thing that i didnt like about it, was the billing needing to be avaliable to make the request.

### Recharts

- The most simple lib for charts that i could find on the internet. Since making a chart from ground zero takes time, i decided to use it because it has some pre-built charts, that you could simply import on your class, and pass your data on it.

## Final note.

- Removi os testes porque vi que nao fariam muito sentido, afinal de contas nao estavam testando muita coisa.

- Agrade√ßo a oportunidade, mesmo se nada der certo, fico feliz por tentar.
