## Features

### Components

- Structured with functional and class components.
- The functional components have some writtens tests.

### CSS

- CSS3 only
- Decided not to use a framework because i wanted to make it simple, and quick.


### Static Data

- The decision behind this was again, work quickly and simple as possible. Mocking an API that could POST, GET, PUT and also DELETE an information would take more time.
- I could search for some public APIs to fetch info, but the idea came to my mind just before I finish the project


-----------------

## Things I wanted to do.

- I wanted to make it as simple and quickly as possible. I dont know how much time I have avaliable, so that is the reason I made that decision.

- I wanted to make it bigger, with more details and some graphics to make it prettier. But as I said before, it would take a bit more effort and thus, more time.

- Some things I left with a comment. Those are things that I would do if I'd encounter myself on the situation mentioned on the comment. I hope you can read those carefully.


--------------------

## Final note

- I hope you like it. It took me around a week to do it. Working on it about an hour per day. Thats the free time that I had during those days, and I used it totally on the project.
- I loved the experience and learned a lot during the process. Thanks for the opportunity.
